# QRDecoder
===================================
QR Decoder using C# and AForge/ZXing libraries
===================================

This project provides a QR decoder implementation in C# using the AForge and ZXing libraries. QR codes are commonly used to store information such as website URLs, contact information, and product details. With this decoder, you can easily scan QR codes and extract their content using your webcam or other image sources.

The project is implemented using C# and utilizes the AForge and ZXing libraries for image processing and QR code decoding. The AForge library is used for capturing images from the webcam, while the ZXing library provides the QR code decoding functionality.

To use the QR decoder, simply run the application and position the QR code in front of your webcam. The decoder will automatically detect the QR code and decode its content. The decoded content is displayed in the application window, and you can copy it to your clipboard or perform other actions as needed.

This project is a great starting point for anyone looking to work with QR codes in their C# projects. Feel free to download and modify the source code as needed, and please let me know if you have any questions or feedback!
